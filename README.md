# Second-Hand-Car-Price-Prediction
To predict the price of the second-hand car based on the dataset of the US using supervised learning.

This project applies the Flask app to deploy a machine learning algorithm trained by using Linear Regression to predict the price of a second-hand car using features such as Brand, Model, Used year, Engine Size, Milerate(miles traveled), and Gear Type.

Dashboard 1 and Dashboard 2 visualize the data using Tableau.

The application was deployed using Heroku.
